# Digital-Door-Lock-System

The Digital Door Lock System project seamlessly combines Arduino for physical hardware implementation with Proteus for virtual simulation. The system is put through rigorous virtual testing using Proteus, which helps us to fine-tune logic and resolve problems before moving to the real world. The main microcontroller, Arduino, integrates sensors and actuators to bring the simulated design to life. With the help of this cooperative synergy between Proteus and Arduino, door locks can now include cutting-edge features like remote access control. The outcome is reliable.
